Rijndael 256-bit Encryption Function (CBC) aka AES

This is an Encryption and Decryption project. 

The code is PHP based. The encryption and decryption is done using mc_encrypt and mc_decrypt method that is used for encryption in PHP.

You need to add your connection details in connection.php

You need to install .sql file, which can be found in the folder.

I'm sure you'll like the UI. It's not some crappy HTML 4 based Encryption-Decryption Project. ;)
